Login
User can login locally into the console when in runlevel  # 3 or graphically when in runlevel  # 5 (the level numbers
may differ depending on the distribution). In both cases you need to provide username and password. Bash uses the
following initialization and start-up files:
1. /etc/profile - The systemwide initialization file, executed for login shells.
2. /etc/bash.bashrc - The systemwide per-interactive-shell startup file. This is a non-standard file which may not
exist on your distribution. Even if it exists, it will not be sourced unless it is done explicitly in another start-up
file.
3. /etc/bash.logout - The systemwide login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits.
4. $HOME/.bash_profile - The personal initialization file, executed for login shells.
5. $HOME/.bashrc - The individual per-interactive-shell startup file.
6. $HOME/.bash_logout - The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits.
7. $HOME/.inputrc - Individual readline initialization file.

Login Shell
Login shells are first shell started when you log in to the system. Login shells set environment which is exported to
non-login shells. Login shell calls the following when a user logs in:
• /etc/profile runs first when a user logs in runlevel # 3 (the level numbers may differ depending on the
distribution).
• /etc/profile.d
• $HOME/.bash_profile, $HOME/.bash_login, and $HOME/.profile, runs second when a user logs in in that order.
$HOME/.bash_profile calls $HOME/.bashrc, which calls /etc/bashrc (/etc/bash.bashrc).
